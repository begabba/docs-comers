## Prerequisites  

Before you proceed make sure to have the necessary credentials:  

- [**Comers**](https://adminang.comers.se)  
- If the price for the new event is lower than the old event you'll also need the prerequisites from [**How to make a refund**](./refund-a-booking.md)  

You'll also need:  

- The __exact__ name of the new event. Let's call it `$EVENTNAME`  
- The starting date of `$EVENTNAME` in Comers format (_13.01.21_). Let's call it `$DATE_FROM`  
- The ending date of `$EVENTNAME` in Comers format (_23.01.21_). Let's call it `$DATE_TO`  

_Make sure you're aware of any administration/cancellation fees according to the booking policies:_  

- [Course/Retreat](https://www.angsbacka.com/about-angsbacka/course-retreat-booking-policy/)  
- [Festivals](https://www.angsbacka.com/about-angsbacka/festival-ticket-policy/)
