# Add Product Price

In this chapter we're going to add the price for all different **Product parts** available for this event.

### Finding the price and template product

All products inherit their price from template products. To set the price for all products of a specific **Product part** we'll need to access it's template product.

The price for a specific **Product part** is found in Comers Overview. 
You'll find the column title and the name of the template product in the following table.

| Product part | Description | Template product | Price column
| ---- | ----------------- | ---- | ----
| SINGLE | Single room | TEMPLATE_SINGLE | PRICE_SINGLE
| BEINDB | Bed in double room | TEMPLATE_BEINDB | PRICE_BEINDB
| BEIN46 | Bed in 4-6 bed room | TEMPLATE_BEIN46 | PRICE_BEIN46
| BEINDO | Bed in a dorm | TEMPLATE_BEINDO | PRICE_BEINDO
| BEDOFEM | Bed in dorm (females only) | TEMPLATE_BEDOFEM | PRICE_BEINDO
| BEDOMIX | Bed in dorm (mixed gender) | TEMPLATE_BEDOMIX | PRICE_BEINDO
| OWNACCO | I arrange my own acc... | TEMPLATE_OWNACCO | PRICE_OWNACCO
| OWNCARA | Caravan parking | TEMPLATE_OWNCARA | PRICE_OWNCARA
| OWNCAPA | 1 Caravan parking required. Passenger in own caravan | TEMPLATE_OWNCAPA | PRICE_OWNTENT
| OWNTENT | Space for own tent | TEMPLATE_OWNTENT | PRICE_OWNTENT
| VOLPOOL | Volunteer Accommodation | TEMPLATE_VOLPOOL | PRICE_VOLPOOL

!!! Note
    For example, if we want to add a price for products of **Product part** `SINGLE` we would need to add the price on the product `TEMPLATE_SINGLE`. The price is found in column `$PRICE_SINGLE` in COMERS OVERVIEW.
