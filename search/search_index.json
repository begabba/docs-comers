Error message or blank window in Spreadsheet? \u00b6 \"ScriptError: We're sorry, a server error occurred while reading from storage. Error code PERMISSION_DENIED.\" This is a bug in Google Sheet that occurs when user is logged in to multiple accounts. The code runs as the default account (first), not the active account, which results in PERMISSION_DENIED. Google has been aware of this bug since November, 2017 and still hasn\u2019t fixed it so it\u2019s best to plan on working around this issue for the time being. While there is not great solution, there are a few options: Log out of all accounts and log in with the angsbacka.se account first. This is the most reliable long term solution. Use an incognito / private window. An incognito window is logged out of all accounts by default so logging in with the work account will cause it to be the only logged in account. This is great for a quick fix, but logging in multiple times can be cumbersome. Use a seperate browser for different accounts. This is a variation of #2. By devoting an entire browser to work and another to personal accounts it avoids this problem and because the session isn\u2019t in an incognito / private window you can stay logged in over time.

A newer version on Google Chrome has probably been released and we'll need to update the Selenium Chrome driver on the computer in the wardrobe office. Don't you worry, it's easy. Find out what's the current version of Google Chrome is. In this case the version is 94. Once we know the Google Chrome version we'll download the Selenium Chrome driver: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads Extract the content of this archive to C:\\FILES\\ANGSBACKA\\PYTHON and replace the old chromedriver.exe . We're done. Restart the computer. It will automatically login and start the necessary software. It might take an hour or two before all bookings are updated. Other \u00b6 One common issue is that the user accidentally deleted or modified the header (top row) in the Spreadsheets. Make sure the top row is intact and spelled exactly as it should. These accidents can be addressed by adding a Protected Range on the first row. Most automations create a log on a successful or failed run. If the IAM & Admin permissions allow it you can access the logs in Google Cloud Platform with the project internal-tools .
